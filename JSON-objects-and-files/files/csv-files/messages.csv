8,Nicole Night,"This can sound daunting, but you don’t actually need to be a statistician or mathlete to do this. All you need is an Excel spreadsheet! Just put your sampling frame—the customers you have contact info for—into your spreadsheet. Once you have your sampling frame (potential survey respondents) in Excel, you can easily select a random sample of them. For example, if you have 3,000 customers and you would like to select a random sample of 500 to receive a customer satisfaction survey, follow these steps:",633177242
9,Peter Pancake,"You don’t want to just select a “convenience sample,” the last 20 people who ordered from you, the last 20 customers when they’re listed alphabetically, etc. All these methods are inherently biased. If you sample the last 20 customers for example, they may be your newest customers who are only familiar with your most recent products or website design. By generating a random sample, you’re minimizing the bias that results from picking an convenience sample from your sampling frame.",10415817242

11,Jerry Smith,"What is a random sample, you may be asking, and why would you need one? Well let’s say, for example, that you want to survey your customers to understand how you’re meeting their needs, and how you could do better.",988104842
